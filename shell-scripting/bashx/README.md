## Description

The database server called centos-host is running short on space! You have been
asked to add an LVM volume for the Database team using some of the existing
disks on this server.

Inspect the requirements in detail by clicking on the icons of the interactive
architecture diagram on the right and complete the tasks. Once done click on
the Check button to validate your work.
