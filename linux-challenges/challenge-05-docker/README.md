## Description

We got a couple of tasks that need to be done on centos-host server. Most of
these tasks are dependent on each other but not all of them.

Inspect the requirements in detail by clicking on the icons of the interactive
architecture diagram on the right and complete the tasks. Once done click on
the Check button to validate your work.
