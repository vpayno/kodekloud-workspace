## Description

Some new developers have joined our team, so we need to create some
users/groups and further need to setup some permissions and access rights for
them.

Inspect the requirements in detail by clicking on the icons of the interactive
architecture diagram on the right and complete the tasks. Once done click on
the Check button to validate your work.
