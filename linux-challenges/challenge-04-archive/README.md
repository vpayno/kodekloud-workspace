# KodeKloud Linux Challenge No. 4 - Archive Data

## Description

Some of our apps generate some raw data and store the same in
/home/bob/preserved directory. We want to clean and manipulate some data and
then want to create an archive of that data.

Note: The validation will verify the final processed data so some of the tests
might fail till all data is processed as asked.

Inspect the requirements in detail by clicking on the icons of the interactive
architecture diagram on the right and complete the tasks. Once done click on
the Check button to validate your work.
